## Gringo alert

The goal behind https://catalunya.tracking.exposed is:

  * exposing the hidden trackers present in website destined for Catalans people
  * collecting websites speaking of politics, designed for the Catalans 

But, **I'm not from Catalunia**, I need the help of locals! This analysis is in the interest of the citizen who uses the internet to get informed.

Adversaries can map the political interests and then influence a target community.

The intersection between the big corporate surveillance market justified as advertising, and the politically driven intelligence agencies intended to preserve the status quo uses these data.

The massive presence of third-party trackers present in websites fed this market. Website owners have the last word on the technologies used on the website, and thus, in the user's data implications

### Exists an Ethically and sustainable way to design a website ;)

And sadly, they are not aware of the privacy implications.

Or maybe, **privacy implication** looks irrelevant, but not during a time of conflict. Like now. Now is the time to raise the awareness.

for this reason: https://catalunya.tracking.exposed is a website at your service and the data produced by the analysis accessible to public scrutiny.

## how you can help?

This repository contains:

  * the website list
  * write the pages in Catalans, copy-written for your community

**I gladly share the management of the repository with any hacktivist organization interested in the topic.**
