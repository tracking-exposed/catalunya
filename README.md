## Gringo alert

the goal behind https://catalunya.tracking.exposed is:

  * exposing the hidden trackers present in website intended for Catalans people
  * collecting websites speaking of politics, intended for the catalans 

But, **I'm not from Catalunia**, I need your help, this analysis is in the interest of the citizen who uses internet to get informed.

Government and privacy agency can map the political interests and influence in your communities. This happen expliting the third party trackers present in many websites. website owner are the ultimate rensponsible for these, but sometime they are not aware of the privacy implication.

maybe privacy implication looks irrelevant, but not during time of conflict. like now.

for this reason: https://catalunya.tracking.exposed is a website at your service, and the data produced
by the analysis accessible to public scrutiny.

## how you can help?

This repository contains:

  * the website list
  * the pages, who has to be translated in your local language, and copy-writed for your community.

**I gladly share the management of the repository with any hacktivist organization interested in the topic.**
